# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> This repository contains a complete implementation of Logistic regression with and without PCA ,XGBOOST,KNN and stacked model of KNN and XGBOOST .

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

* Algorithms - It contains the implementation of Logistic regression without PCA ,with PCA ,KNN with PCA .
* Stacked_model.py - It contains the implementation of Stacked model of KNN and XGBOOST .
* xgboost_.py - It contains the implementation of XGboost Algorithm.

---

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

* Make sure numpy and pandas are imported
* Also i assumed that the train and test dataset are same as assignment -2 's datasets hence i removed even column from them explicitly .
* If the test dataset doesnt have even column just comment out the line where i removed even column

---

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

* Mention the instructions to run you .py files.
  
---

## You can further add your own sections/titles along with corresponding contents here:
* The stacked model code didnt run in my system .It gave the session crashed out as it used all the available RAM .So i didnt mention any F1 scores or related values in report .

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
